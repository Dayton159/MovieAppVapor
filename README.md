## Overview
This project is created for me to practice using Vapor which is a Server Side Swift Framework to act as a backend service of my own apps. In this project I use PostgreSQL as my chosen database from the Vapor Fluent ORM.


##  First Setting
* Create the database
<pre>CREATE DATABASE moviesdb</pre>

* Edit Project Scheme and change custom working directory to your directory settings
* Check the database setting(username,password,etc) on server's configure file

## Migrations
After the setting is done, proceed with migration on your project directory
<pre>vapor run migrate</pre>

## Vapor
